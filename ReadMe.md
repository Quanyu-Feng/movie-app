Movie App
This project is a movie application I developed independently during my time working with an HK IELTS Educational Training Institution.

How to Run the Application
1. Live Server Extension: To run this application, you need to download and install the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code. After installation, click the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner of the Visual Studio Code interface. This will launch the application in your default web browser.

Note on Media Files:
The MP4 file originally included in this project has been removed due to its large file size.
